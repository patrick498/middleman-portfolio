        <h1>Hi, I'm Patrick ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <h4>
          I'm a web developer based in Kanagawa, Japan, with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails. I recently completed the Le Wagon web development bootcamp where I learned to build dynamic, user-focused websites and applications.

        <h4>
          I'm passionate about coding, and I strive to create clean, efficient code while delivering seamless user experiences. Outside of development, I've recently started playing chess, which helps me think strategically and stay sharp. Feel free to check out my work and reach out if you'd like to connect!
